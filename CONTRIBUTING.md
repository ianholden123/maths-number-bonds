# Contributing to this project

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute to this project! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

This project and all contributors are governed by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [ianholdendev@outlook.com](mailto:ianholdendev@outlook.com).

## What should I know before I get started?

### Design Decisions

#### Tech Stack

This project was built in React and I would prefer it to stay in this technology. If you wish to port this to a new tech stack, I would recommend forking this repository and rebuilding it in a separate repository.

#### Devices

This project was built to be used on larger screened devices, primarily tablet and desktop viewports. Where possible, I have tried to ensure that the CSS is written in a responsive way, however when we get down to mobile viewport sizes, I am happy to leave some visual elements in an unoptimised state.

If you feel that this is an area that you can contribute to, I would love to see what you can come up with.

## How Can I Contribute?
