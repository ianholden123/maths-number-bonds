## Installation

### Install dependencies

You must have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and **NPM** installed before you can work with this project. In the project directory, you must first install the project's dependencies using npm:

`npm install`

### Development

To run the app in development mode, run the following script:

`npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Building the project

To build the project in preparation for it to be hosted on a production environment, you must run the following script:

`npm run build`

This will build the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Testing

Run the following script to launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode:

`npm test`

## Customising this project

Some additional configurations can be made before building the project by accessing the configuration files in the `/src/config` directory.

If you intend on making changes to the colour of each phase in the `/src/config/phases.js` file, be aware that HEX colour values will work best. For example, instead of using a colour value such as `blue`, use `#0000ff`. Note that we have specified the hash (#) before the RGB value too. This is important for manipulating the font colour on the results grid.

## Possible improvements

This project has been designed for desktop and tablet devices mainly but does contain some responsive elements. Further work may be required however for this app to display nicely on mobile devices.

This project could definitely benefit from some more unit tests.
